// A MouseArea for a right-click menu that opens at the pointer. The menu opens where the
// button went DOWN, not where Qt says it came up: with a menu already open (an xdg-popup
// grab), Qt on Wayland reports the release relative to that popup — a second right-click
// on the wallpaper put the new menu off by the old menu's position (B2). Left and middle
// clicks are passed on as they are.
