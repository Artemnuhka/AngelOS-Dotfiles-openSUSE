# angelOS owner check: is the GitHub account logged in here (gh) an admin of the
# private admin repository? Owner features (services/Owner) and the owner's publish
# script switch on only then — the owner/ folder and the marker file alone are not
# enough, anyone could copy those.

#   owner-check.sh <admin repo url>   prints one line:
#     admin <login>    gh says this account administers the repo (remembered)
#     cached <login>   gh could not ask (offline, no gh), but it did within 14 days
#     denied <login>   gh answered: no admin rights / no such repo for this account
#     unknown          no gh login and nothing remembered
# The answer is GitHub's: nothing here can be edited to say yes.
